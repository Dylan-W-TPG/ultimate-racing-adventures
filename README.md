## Known Bugs
<b>NOTE: The game has some bugs since I no longer have its Unity project.</b>
- After completing a Time Attack or Score Attack course, the results and money additions no longer work.
- In some cases when the race starts, it shortly interrupts and returns to the main menu without warning.
- Entering the results screen before the race finish cinematic ends will cause the cars to go unresponsive on the following races. Moving back to the main menu and then entering the race will reset and fix the problem.
- Some collisions with cars tend to be awkward and can easily cause them to get stuck.
